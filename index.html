        collection and processing of your messages as described herein.

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>

    <h2>Data Access</h2>
    <p>
        Access to your data is limited to the bot owner and one trusted collaborator responsible for bot development. We do not share 
        your information with third parties unless illegal activity is detected, in which case we may disclose your data to law enforcement

    <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Your messages will remain stored indefinitely unless a removal request is made. Upon receipt of such a request, we will strive to 
        delete your data promptly, but please allow up to one month for processing.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you are entitled to access, rectify, or request the deletion of your data at any time.
