    <h1>Data Storage and Privacy Policy for LaVivaBot</h1>
    <p>
        This bot stores your messages indefinitely to improve its functionality and user experience. By using this bot, 
        you agree to the storage and processing of your messages. If you would like your data (messages) to be removed, 
        please send a request to the Discord user <strong>'maracujacraft'</strong>. We will respond to your request 
        within one month and may extend this period if necessary, notifying you if additional time is needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Can See Your Data:</h2>
    <p>
        - Only I, the bot owner, and one trusted collaborator who helps with coding the bot, have access to your data.<br>
        - Your messages and data will not be shared with any third parties, except in cases where illegal activity is detected, 
        in which case your data may be shared with legal authorities as required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security:</h2>
    <p>
        We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access. However, please note that no system 
        is entirely immune to security risks.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention:</h2>
    <p>
        Your messages are stored indefinitely unless you specifically request their removal. Upon receiving your request, we will 
        make every effort to delete your data as soon as possible, but it may take up to one month for the process to be completed.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Requests</h2>
    <p>
        If you request access to your data, we will inform you whether we hold any data associated with your account. 
        If we do not have any data to provide, we will communicate this clearly. 
        Please note that data retention practices may vary, and not all user interactions may be stored indefinitely.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights:</h2>
    <p>
        In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to access, correct, or request the 
        deletion of your data at any time. If you have any concerns or questions, or if you wish to exercise your rights, please 
        contact us via Discord.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal Compliance:</h2>
    <p>
        In the event that illegal activity is detected, we reserve the right to share your data with relevant legal authorities 
        as required by applicable laws.
